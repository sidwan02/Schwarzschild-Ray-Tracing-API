# schwarzschild-ray-tracing-app

## App Descriptions

### Short

Generate light ray traces that bend around blackholes in 2D or 3D space!

### Long

Choose light sources and give initial angle deflections to produce rays of light. Then, watch as those light rays bend around a blackhole in 2D or 3D space!

For 2D traces, you have the ability to do so by dragging your finger over your device's screen. For 2D and 3D traces, you can generate traces using manual inputs.

You have the ability to store your traces using the inbuilt graphing widget. For 2D traces this can be accessed in the Trace Analysis, and for 3D traces it will directly populate.

Limited knowledge about blackholes can be helpful but is not required. Some basic understanding of direction cosines is helpful but not necessary for generating 3D traces.
